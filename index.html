                    <h2>The Hard Drive Guys was born out of frustration with existing data recovery services. You shouldn't be emptying your purse for a headache.</h2>
                    At first, the Hard Drive Guys was just a side hobby for a few college kids. Soon enough, it turned into much more than that. Your memories, personal notes, business documents, and photos are stored on your computer. However, when those are lost, it can feel like your whole world has been turned upside down.
                    At HDG, we don't want anyone to ever have that sinking feeling in their stomach. We provide industry leading data recovery services that don't cost an arm and a leg. Scroll down for more information.
